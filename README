ktimetrace is currently available over the world wide web from

http://ktimetrace.sourceforge.net

There isn't much documentation at the moment.  Most of the
controls in the dialogs have 'what's this?' help though.  Click
on the button with the question mark, then click on the control
you are interested in.

Please send any bug reports or suggestions to the ktimetrace
mailing list (see web page) or email fmhess@users.sourceforge.net
