1.00:	Original version 6/00 FMH

1.01:	Made kapp->processEvents() occur every 1/10th of a second (up to a
	maximum of once per point) instead of every 100 data points.

1.02:	Made saved data map -5 to +5 volts onto -2048 to +2047 instead of
	mapping onto 0 to 4095.  This is to maintain backward compatibility
	with old DOS timetrace programs.

1.03:	Changed 'ok' button focus policy to StrongFocus in order to fix
	bug with QSpinBoxes not updating.

1.04:	REALLY fixed problem with QSpinBoxes this time by setting focus
	to okButton when it is pressed (before pressing alt-o could activate
	okButton without shifting focus to it.)

	Made main window caption display name of file being recorded.

	Added progress bar.

1.05:	Fixed problem with window caption not displaying the correct
	file number for the first data file taken after opening program

1.06:	Fixed graphics so they only update when there is no data waiting
	to be read.

2.00:	First port to KDE2 / QT2.2.  Only changed lines to load start/stop
	icons and set initial window size

2.01:	Improved interruption of data taking so it doesn't falsely indicate
	interruption succeeded (only happened very rarely.) Fixed Dialog
	problems due to change in QT signals from version 1 to version 2.

2.02:	Made settings save into configuration file upon exit of program.

2.03:	First port to COMEDI device drivers

2.04: Fixed bugs that prevented taking more than one channel and
	caused program to ask for wrong number of points from comedi.
	Fixed bug in adc::start where one extra element was written
	to chanList array.

2.05: Added new save file format options so data can be saved
	as tab delimited text, optionally gzipped.

*** appended zero to begginning of version number
for first public release

0.2.06:	Added fallback triggers to adc class.  Made program less
	dependent on particulars of a/d hardware used.  Added
	selectable ranges.  Made text file output in volts instead
	of integer.

0.2.07:	Made text files output in scientific format.  Fixed bug
	with save filename, fixed bug with repaint after data taking
	is complete.	2000-12-31 FMH

0.2.08:	Fixed crashing associated with 'defaults' button. Added
	option to set analog reference.  Fixed adc object so it works
	with older versions of comedi that are buggier.  Gzipping of
	text files now done in background.  Added some checks that
	save file directory is valid.  Made plotting for 16 bit cards
	work.

0.2.09: Made program stop when an error from comedi terminates
	data collection, instead of waiting forever for more data.

0.2.10: Fixed a memory leak introduced in 0.2.09.  Sends
	stop command to data card in the event of unexpected error.
	Greatly reduced load on cpu by buffering reads from comedi into
	1 kbyte blocks instead of one data point at a time.  Made
	data stream to disk instead of accumulating in memory.
	Gzipping is also done on the fly using zlib.

0.2.11: Tried to make screen update at least every 1% of data
	taken.  Improved efficiency of some adc member function calls.
	Reworked streaming to disk so it streams raw data to temporary
	file then processes it at the end.  Fixed bug that caused
	problems when plotting was not updated often enough during
	fast data collection

0.2.12: Made which comedi device to use configurable.
	Made program autodetect a working analog input on any of the
	comedi device files.

0.2.13: Used tmpfile() function to create proper temporary file
	instead of trying to do it myself.  Added check for write
	errors to files (for example disk full).

0.2.14: Fixed toolbar problem with kdelib 2.1

0.2.15: Added support for external trigger to start aquisition

0.2.16: Split ktimetrace.cpp and ktimetrace.h into multiple files.
	made it check settings of default triggers with board.
	Added some comments to header files.  Added save directory dialog.
	Added support for choosing begin scan and conversion triggers.
	Dropped averaging of samples for the time being.

0.2.17: added checkboxes for TRIG_RT and TRIG_WAKE_EOS.
	Made graphics update continuously or in blocks depending on
	TRIG_WAKE_EOS.  Cleaned up KTraceData object a bit.

0.2.18: Made progress bar update once per second.
	Fixed bug with dialog having some scan triggers show up in start trigger
	combobox.

0.2.19: Fixed low latency mode plotting glitch.  Made program multithreaded,
	there is now no delay in waiting for save file to be written at
	end of aquisition, since the writing of the save file has a
	seperate thread.  Added display of boardname to dialog. Added some
	popup warning messages on errors.  Added 'what's this?' help to widgets
	in dialog.

0.2.20: Fixed some problems with program exit due to bugs in qt.  Added
	saving of main window configuration.  Made sure all asynchronous file
	writes complete before program exits.  Made real time and low latency
	settings save to config file.  2001-06-13

0.2.21: Fixes for compile on RedHat 7.1.  Added configuration dialog
	for comedi's buffer.

0.2.22: Added popup message to tell user when application
	closing is delayed due to file writing in progress.  Added more popup
	messageboxes for errors.  Got rid of some junk in help menu.  Added
	'control' menu, which does nothing new really.  Fixed a race that
	happened when the file writing thread encountered a write error.  Fix
	for compile on SuSe 6.4.  Added some checking of settings when the
	device is switched.

0.2.23: Fixed corruption of writeThreadCount.

0.2.24: Fixed sending of TRIG_RT and TRIG_WAKE_EOS comedi_cmd flags.

0.2.25: Limited number of channels to board's capability.  More
	than 8 channels can be chosen now (only the first 8 are displayed).
	Added check to see if range is actually in volts.  Added a status
	LED indicator that indicates how many files are being written in the
	background.  Added a status LED which indicates if a working analog
	input is open.  Added a brief man page.

0.2.26: Split off KTTSettings class from KTraceData.  Added horizontal
	zoom option.  Enabled changing of max buffer size (with root privilege).
	Now requires comedilib-0.7.16.

0.2.27: Fixed toolbar for kde-2.2.  Converted to KMainWindow from deprecated
	KTMainWindow.

0.2.28: Changed meanings of led indicators!  Made sure
	toolbar can't be hidden due to a weird setting in config file.  Added
	horizontal zoom buttons and display.  Greatly
	increased cpu efficiency of plotting in 'point-by-point' mode,
	although there is still room for improvement especially for
	point-by-point mode with very low zoom.

0.2.29: More tuning to plotting routine, I'm quite happy with it now.

0.2.30: Tweaks to point-by-point plotting.  Corrected off-by-one
	error in displayed display width.  Added input
	range, input units, and input reference to parameter file.  Made it get
	supported analog references
	from driver instead of always displaying ground/common/differential options.  Added
	display of current horizontal zoom factor.  Added check for sucessful
	writing of .ts-par file.  Added color selection dialogs to make plotting colors
	customizable.

0.2.31: Added calls to comedi_poll() when in low latency mode for
	drivers that don't support TRIG_WAKE_EOS but do support comedi_poll() (only
	the das16m1.c driver as far as I know, but hey I have one.)  Fixed bug in
	selection of input reference introduced in 0.2.30.  Added support for selection
	of stop trigger.  Changes due to addition of external stop trigger support
	now requires comedi version > 0.7.60 (cvs versions newer than 2001-10-19 are okay)
	in order for hardware errors during aquisition
	to be detected reliably.  Added number of scans actually completed to parameter
	file (changed label for number of scans requested!).  Added board name to
	parameter file.

0.2.32: Made multithreading more aggressive.  Disabled comboboxes
	in dialog that don't have more than one option.  Debian packaging files added.
	Added capability to execute user-defined shell command at beginning and/or
	end of data aquisition.

0.2.33: Really added Debian packaging files this time (they got
	left out of released tarball last time).  Fixed setting of shell variable
	KTT_DATA_FILE for file names with spaces or other special characters.
	Fixed compilation under gcc-3.0.

0.2.34: Did (trivial) port so ktimetrace now compiles against kde version 3 as
	well as version 2.  Fixed reading back of modified scan and convert arguments
	after aquisition is started, for later display as initial values in dialog.  Made
	'true binary' save file format always save to little endian byte ordering.  Improved
	widget layout to be less sensitive to font size.

0.2.35: Fixed compilation problems with systems that use automake > 1.4

0.2.36: Another automake > 1.4 fix

0.2.37: Fixed gcc 3 compiler errors/warnings (Dave Schleef).  Updated admin files from
	kde 3.3.2.
